# Cattle Weight Prediction

This project focuses on predicting cattle weight based on keypoint data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model estimates the weight of cattle using key points from images or structured data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning regression model that predicts the weight of cattle using keypoint data. Key points represent specific parts of the cattle's body, such as the head, legs, and torso, and are used to estimate the weight.

## Dataset

We are gathering real-time data from a cattle farm, focusing on two main approaches. To support this, we are implementing a series of forms to capture image data of the cattle. For each cow, we will collect four images—front, back, side, and top views—along with the ground truth weight of the animal.
